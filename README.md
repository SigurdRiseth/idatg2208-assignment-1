# Assignment 1 – IDATG2208

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for Assignment 1 in the IDATG2208 – Introduction to Machine Learning course. The assignment applies machine learning concepts from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron on the Wine Quality Dataset from Kaggle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this assignment is the Wine Quality Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset).

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SigurdRiseth/idatg2208-assignment-1
    cd idatg2208-assignment-1
    ```
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## Usage

Open and run the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory to explore the assignment solutions.
